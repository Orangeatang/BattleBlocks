* Improve collision detection & speed controls
	- make sure you can't move halfway through voxels
	- make sure sprint/walk commands properly affect jumping

* replace all appropriate pointers with smart pointers

* Skybox

* add in a more intelligent terrain building system, something that can do tiered terrain - looking at surrounding chunks to decide what to make next

* Memory pooling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool

* shadow maps

	- implement lighting for point lights (cube maps http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch12.html http://www.braynzarsoft.net/index.php?p=D3D11CUBEMAP)
	- soft shadows

* improve terrain generation
	- colour map for voxel types (currently a default grass colour is used in the chunk thread)
	- map different colours to voxels at different heights

* height map generation should be moved in to a separate thread

* Add a class that can log messages to a file, keep an instance in the engine for error messages etc

* add the ability to turn features on/off in the render manager
